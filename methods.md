Oysters

Three hatchery-raised populations obtained from distinct bays within Puget Sound, WA:  Fidalgo Bay (48°28'31.1"N 122°34'48.6"W), Dabob Bay (47°49'27.4"N 122°48'37.9"W), and Oyster Bay (47°06'21.2"N 123°04'32.8"W).


Tissue Collection

Size/Age?

Thirty two oysters from each population were shucked into 1.5mL snap cap tubes and stored at -80C.

Sample Preparation and Sequencing

Isolation of DNA, library preparation and sequencing were performed by the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI; Beijing, China). Isolation of DNA was by via the salting out method. Briefly, tissue was lysed with Proteinase K, followed by ethanol precipitation of nucleic acids.
