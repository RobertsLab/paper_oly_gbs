  abstractnote = {Background: Next generation sequencing (NGS) is a widely used technology in both basic research and clinical settings and it will continue to have a major impact on biomedical sciences. However, the use of incorrect normalization methods can lead to systematic biases and spurious results, making the selection of an appropriate normalization strategy a crucial and often overlooked part of NGS analysis. Results: We present a basic introduction to the currently available normalization methods for differential expression and ChIP-seq applications, along with best use recommendations for different experimental techniques and datasets. We demonstrate that the choice of normalization technique can have a significant impact on the number of genes called as differentially expressed in an RNA-seq experiment or peaks called in a ChIP-seq experiment. Conclusions: The choice of the most adequate normalization method depends on both the distribution of signal in the dataset and the intended downstream applications. Depending on the design and purpose of the study, appropriate bias correction should also be considered.},

  abstractnote = {De novo assembled transcriptomes, in combination with RNA-Seq, are powerful tools to explore gene sequence and expression level in organisms without reference genomes. Investigators must first choose which high throughput sequencing platforms will provide data most suitable for their experimental goals. In this study, we explore the utility of 454 and Illumina sequences for de novo transcriptome assembly and downstream RNA-Seq applications in a reproductive gland from a non-model bird species, the Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica). Four transcriptomes composed of either pure 454 or Illumina reads or mixtures of read types were assembled and evaluated for the same cost. Illumina assemblies performed best for de novo transcriptome characterization in terms of contig length, transcriptome coverage, and complete assembly of gene transcripts. Improvements over the Hybrid assembly were marginal, with the exception that the addition of 454 data significantly increased the number of genes annotated. The Illumina assembly provided the best reference to align an independent set of RNA-Seq data as ∼84% of reads mapped to single genes in the transcriptome. Contigs constructed solely from 454 data may impose problems for RNA-Seq as our 454 transcriptome revealed a high number of indels and many ambiguously mapped reads. Correcting the 454 transcriptome with Illumina reads was an effective strategy to deal with indel and frameshift errors inherent to the 454 transcriptome, but at the cost of transcriptome coverage. In the absence of a reference genome, we find that Illumina reads alone produced a high quality transcriptome appropriate for RNA-Seq gene expression analyses.},
