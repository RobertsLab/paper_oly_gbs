# Technical Validation

Input DNA quality was evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis (Data Citation 2: http://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/J8RC2). All samples used for library construction were scored by BGI as "Level A", meaning the integrity of the input DNA is good and the amount of sample is sufficient for two or more library constructions.
