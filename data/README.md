## This directory provides the key files that summarize this project. 

### All files were generated and provided by BGI at the conclusion of the sequencing project.
- ```Data.stat.xls```: Spreadsheet detailing number of reads generated, number of bases sequenced, GC percentage, Q20 percentage, and Q30 percentage for each individual.

- ```Genotype.xls```: Spreadsheet providing consensus sequences of genomic regions containing SNPs across individuals; effectively provides a genotype for each individual.

- ```SNP.readme_en.txt```: A readme file describing the columns in the ```SNP.stat.csv``` file.

- ```SNP.stat.xls```: Spreadsheet summarizing total number of SNPs identified in each individual, as well as breakdown of homozygous/heteroyzgous SNP composition in each individual.

- ```genotype.noref.readme_en.txt```: A readme file describing the columns in the ```Genotype.xls``` file.

- ```nj_tree.out.tre.png```: A low resolution PNG image of phylogenetic tree of all individual oysters, generated using the Neighbor-Joining method.

- ```nj_tree.out.tre.svg```: A scalable SVG of phylogenetic tree of all individual oysters, generated using the Neighbor-Joining method. Can be used to create higher resolution image (compared to the ```nj_tree.out.tre.png``` file) of the phylogenetic tree.
