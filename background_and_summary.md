# Background & Summary

Populations of the once abundant Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida), have declined precipitously along the U.S. west coast due to habitat deterioration, overfishing, and pollution (Baker 1995; Blake and zu Ermgassen 2015). These declines led the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) to list the Olympia oyster as a Washington state “species of concern”. Despite reductions in wild harvest due to a lack of commercial viability, natural recovery has been limited. Recent field observations suggest that settlement and recruitment are not limiting re-establishment of the species. The life history strategy of the Olympia oyster By virtue of brooding larvae, may result in some degree of reproductive isolation, resulting in genetic differences among populations. Without information on genetic stock structure, inadvertent transfers of stocks for restoration aquaculture may be erasing these differences, despite well-intentioned efforts to localize broodstocks and outplants. Hatchery production typically exploits the high fecundities of marine bivalves, using few broodstock to produce large numbers of outplants (Saavedra 1997). Following this strategy, Ne and genetic diversity are reduced in the very populations being “restored”, leaving them genetically depauperate. Thus, while census numbers of Olympia oysters in restored populations may increase, genetic diversity, and thus the resilience of the population to environmental change, may be seriously impaired. It is therefore critical to properly characterize hierarchical genetic differentiation in this iconic species.
